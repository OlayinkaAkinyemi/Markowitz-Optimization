# Markowitz-Optimization
This project implements markowitz model for portfolio optimization. It develops an efficient frontier and locates important points on, within and outside of the effiecient frontier. 
Each point on the efficient frontier is gotten from a set of optimized weights assigned to each asset in the portfolio.
The weights are optimized in order to minimize the risk for a given level of return (mean of the return of each asset).
For any point inside the frontier, there is a point north of it on the frontier that maximizes the return for that level of risk, or west of it on the frontier that minimizes the risk at that level of return.
Data is sourced from the EDHEC Business School, France.
